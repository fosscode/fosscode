# Project Plan: fosscode

## Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight, fast command-line application with a text user interface (TUI) for performing code agent interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). The application will support multiple LLM providers including Grok, OpenAI, LMStudio, OpenRouter, and others. It must be optimized for resource-constrained environments like VPS instances with minimal memory and CPU requirements.

## Objectives
- Create a lightweight, fast CLI/TUI tool for LLM-powered code assistance
- Support multiple LLM providers with unified interface
- Enable seamless code agent workflows and interactions
- Optimize for minimal resource usage (memory, CPU, startup time)
- Follow open source best practices and security standards
- Build a community of developers using AI for coding on resource-constrained hosts

## Scope
- Develop lightweight CLI application with minimal TUI using TypeScript and Bun
- Optimize for fast startup and low memory footprint (< 50MB RAM)
- Implement efficient LLM provider integrations with connection pooling
- Create streamlined code agent interaction workflows
- Add configuration management optimized for small storage
- Implement conversation history with efficient data structures
- Add comprehensive TypeScript types and error handling
- Create npm-compatible package with binary executable
- Enable installation via `npm install -g fosscode`
- Add documentation, testing, and release initial version

## Resources Needed
### Technical Resources
- **Development Environment**: Bun runtime, TypeScript 5+, VS Code or similar IDE with Bun extension
- **Version Control**: Git (already set up)
- **Package Manager**: Bun for development, npm for distribution and installation
- **TUI Framework**: Ink (React-based) or Blessed for terminal interfaces
- **LLM SDKs**: OpenAI SDK, custom integrations for Grok/LMStudio/OpenRouter
- **Testing Framework**: Jest or Vitest with TypeScript support
- **Documentation Tools**: TypeDoc for API docs, Markdown for user guides
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and npm publishing
- **Build Tools**: Bun's native bundler for creating executable binaries, pkg or ncc for npm packages

### Human Resources
- 1-2 TypeScript/Node.js developers with CLI application experience
- Developer familiar with LLM APIs and prompt engineering
- Technical reviewer with TypeScript and TUI development experience
- Documentation writer familiar with developer tools
- Community manager for engagement

### Budget Considerations
- **Development Costs**: Minimal hosting requirements (can develop on local machine or free tier VPS)
- **CI/CD Costs**: GitHub Actions minutes for automated testing and npm publishing
- **Publishing Costs**: npm publishing (free), potential domain for documentation
- **Marketing Materials**: Screenshots, demos, and promotional content for release
- **API Credits**: Budget for testing LLM provider APIs during development
- **VPS Testing**: Low-cost VPS instances for performance testing across different providers

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### 1. LLM Provider API Changes
**Risk**: Providers change APIs, deprecate endpoints, or modify response formats
**Mitigation**:
- Use official SDKs where available and keep dependencies updated
- Implement abstraction layer to isolate provider-specific code
- Monitor provider documentation and release notes regularly
- Have fallback providers configured for critical functionality

### 2. API Rate Limiting and Costs
**Risk**: LLM API usage exceeds rate limits or incurs unexpected costs
**Mitigation**:
- Implement request queuing and rate limiting in the application
- Add cost estimation and usage tracking features
- Provide clear documentation on API usage and costs
- Implement caching for repeated requests where appropriate

### 3. TUI Compatibility Issues
**Risk**: Terminal interface doesn't work properly across different terminal emulators
**Mitigation**:
- Test on multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows) and terminal types
- Use well-maintained TUI libraries with good compatibility
- Provide fallback modes for limited terminal capabilities
- Include troubleshooting documentation for common issues

### 4. API Key Security
**Risk**: Sensitive API keys are exposed or mishandled
**Mitigation**:
- Use secure key storage mechanisms (OS keychain, encrypted config files)
- Never log or expose API keys in error messages or logs
- Implement proper key validation and rotation mechanisms
- Follow security best practices for credential management

### 5. LLM Response Quality and Performance
**Risk**: Inconsistent or slow LLM responses affecting user experience
**Mitigation**:
- Implement response validation and error handling for malformed responses
- Add timeout handling and retry logic for failed requests
- Provide loading indicators and progress feedback in TUI
- Cache successful responses where appropriate to improve performance

### 6. Dependency on External Services
**Risk**: Application becomes unusable if LLM providers are down
**Mitigation**:
- Implement offline mode capabilities where possible
- Provide clear error messages when services are unavailable
- Design with service degradation in mind (graceful fallbacks)
- Monitor provider status pages and implement health checks

### 7. Scope Creep
**Risk**: Adding unplanned LLM providers or features extends timeline
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize core providers (OpenAI, Grok) for initial release
- Use modular architecture to easily add providers later
- Maintain strict milestone adherence for MVP features

### 8. Security Vulnerabilities
**Risk**: Code contains security flaws, especially in API handling
**Mitigation**:
- Follow secure coding practices for API key and data handling
- Use automated security scanning tools (npm audit, Snyk)
- Conduct security review focusing on LLM integration points
- Implement input validation and sanitization for all user inputs

### 9. Performance Regression
**Risk**: Performance optimizations break functionality or create new bottlenecks
**Mitigation**:
- Establish performance benchmarks early in development
- Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks before optimization
- Implement comprehensive testing to ensure optimizations don't break features
- Monitor memory usage and startup time throughout development

### 10. npm Publishing Issues
**Risk**: Package publishing fails or installation issues arise
**Mitigation**:
- Test package creation and installation on multiple platforms
- Follow npm best practices for executable packages
- Use proper package.json configuration for CLI tools
- Set up automated publishing pipeline with proper error handling
