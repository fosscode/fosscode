# Reproducible Builds Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks needed to implement reproducible builds for the fosscode project.

## Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] **Pin dependency versions exactly in package.json** (ID: pin-dependencies)
  - Replace ^ ranges with exact versions to prevent variations from dependency updates
  - Example: Change `"^0.60.0"` to `"0.60.0"`

- [ ] **Review and modify build scripts** (ID: deterministic-scripts)
  - Ensure build scripts avoid non-deterministic elements like timestamps or random IDs
  - Review package.json scripts section

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Add reproducible flags to Bun compile** (ID: bun-compile-flags)
  - Modify build:exe script to include reproducibility flags
  - Research Bun compile options for deterministic builds

- [ ] **Standardize build environment** (ID: standardize-environment)
  - Ensure consistent Bun version, OS, and architecture
  - Pin Bun version in CI/CD and development environments

- [ ] **Verify with build comparison** (ID: verify-builds)
  - Build project multiple times in identical environments
  - Compare outputs using diff or hash comparison
  - Create script to automate build verification locally

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Implement CI/CD reproducibility verification** (ID: ci-cd-verification)
  - Add GitHub Actions job to build project twice in parallel
  - Compare build artifacts using checksums (SHA256)
  - Fail CI if builds are not identical
  - Test across multiple platforms (Linux x64, ARM64, macOS Intel/ARM64, Windows)
  - Use Docker containers for consistent build environments
  - Cache dependencies to ensure consistency
  - Add reproducibility badge to README

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Document and automate** (ID: document-automate)
  - Document CI/CD verification process in AGENTS.md
  - Create automated scripts for local verification
  - Add troubleshooting guide for reproducibility failures
  - Set up monitoring/alerts for reproducibility regressions

## Notes
- The bun.lock file already provides dependency locking
- Focus on build:exe script for binary reproducibility
- Test in multiple environments to ensure consistency
