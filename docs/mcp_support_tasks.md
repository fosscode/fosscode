# MCP Support Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Enable Model Context Protocol (MCP) support in fosscode to allow integration with MCP servers like Playwright for browser automation and other tools.

## Tasks

### 1. Research and Design
- [ ] Analyze MCP protocol specification and requirements
- [ ] Review existing experimental MCP implementation in codebase
- [ ] Design MCP provider architecture integration with ProviderManager
- [ ] Define configuration schema for MCP servers (command, args, timeout, etc.)

### 2. Core Implementation
- [ ] Create MCPProvider.ts in src/providers/
- [ ] Implement MCP client communication layer
- [ ] Add tool discovery and execution capabilities
- [ ] Handle MCP server process management (start/stop)
- [ ] Integrate MCP tools with fosscode's tool execution system

### 3. Configuration Management
- [ ] Extend config schema to support MCP provider settings
- [ ] Update config.example.json with MCP configuration examples
- [ ] Add validation for MCP server commands and arguments
- [ ] Implement secure storage for MCP-specific settings

### 4. Authentication and Security
- [ ] Implement MCP server authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Add security checks for MCP server processes
- [ ] Handle MCP server permissions and sandboxing
- [ ] Add timeout and resource limit controls

### 5. Testing and Integration
- [ ] Test with Playwright MCP server as primary use case
- [ ] Create unit tests for MCP provider functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests with sample MCP servers
- [ ] Update documentation with MCP setup instructions

### 6. Documentation and User Experience
- [ ] Update README.md with MCP support details
- [ ] Add MCP authentication command (`fosscode auth login mcp`)
- [ ] Create MCP server configuration examples
- [ ] Add verbose mode support for MCP tool execution

### 7. Deployment and Packaging
- [ ] Ensure MCP dependencies are properly bundled
- [ ] Update Docker configuration for MCP server access
- [ ] Test MCP functionality in containerized environments
- [ ] Update build scripts to include MCP-related binaries if needed

## Dependencies
- MCP protocol library or implementation
- Process management utilities
- Enhanced provider manager

## Priority
- High: Core implementation and Playwright integration
- Medium: Configuration and testing
- Low: Advanced features and optimizations

## Notes
- Start with Playwright MCP server as the primary test case
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing providers
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
