## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your contributions, you must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This agreement allows us to relicense your contributions for proprietary purposes while ensuring that the open-source nature of the project is maintained.

### Why do we require a CLA?

- **Relicensing Flexibility**: The CLA allows the project maintainers to relicense the code if needed for proprietary use cases
- **Legal Protection**: Ensures that contributors have the legal right to contribute the code
- **Community Benefit**: Helps maintain the project's sustainability and long-term viability

### How to Sign the CLA

To contribute, you must agree to the Contributor License Agreement. Comment on the relevant pull request or issue with the following text:

"I have read and agree to the Contributor License Agreement as outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)."

This serves as your electronic signature agreeing to the terms.

The CLA terms are based on the [Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual) for individuals and [Google Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate) for corporations.
