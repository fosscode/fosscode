# Agent Tools Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive set of tools that will enable AI agents to interact with both the filesystem and the web. These tools will provide capabilities for searching, reading, writing, and modifying files, as well as searching and retrieving web content, making the agent a powerful assistant for code-related tasks and research.

## Objectives
- Enable AI agents to search through codebases using grep-like functionality
- Allow agents to read files completely or read specific line ranges
- Provide file writing capabilities for creating new files
- Implement content replacement functionality for editing existing files
- Enable web search and content retrieval for research and information gathering
- Ensure all tools are secure and follow best practices
- Create a modular, extensible architecture for future tool additions
