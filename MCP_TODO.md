# MCP Support Implementation Todos

## 1. Research and Design
- [ ] Analyze MCP protocol specification and requirements
- [ ] Review existing experimental MCP implementation in codebase  
- [ ] Design MCP provider architecture integration with ProviderManager
- [ ] Define configuration schema for MCP servers (command, args, timeout, etc.)

## 2. Core Implementation
- [ ] Create MCPProvider.ts in src/providers/
- [ ] Implement MCP client communication layer
- [ ] Add tool discovery and execution capabilities
- [ ] Handle MCP server process management (start/stop)
- [ ] Integrate MCP tools with fosscode's tool execution system

## 3. Configuration Management
- [ ] Extend config schema to support MCP provider settings
- [ ] Update config.example.json with MCP configuration examples
- [ ] Add validation for MCP server commands and arguments
- [ ] Implement secure storage for MCP-specific settings

## 4. Authentication and Security
- [ ] Implement MCP server authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Add security checks for MCP server processes
- [ ] Handle MCP server permissions and sandboxing
- [ ] Add timeout and resource limit controls

## 5. Testing and Integration
- [ ] Test with Playwright MCP server as primary use case
- [ ] Create unit tests for MCP provider functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests with sample MCP servers
- [ ] Update documentation with MCP setup instructions

## 6. Documentation and User Experience
- [ ] Update README.md with MCP support details
- [ ] Add MCP authentication command (fosscode auth login mcp)
- [ ] Create MCP server configuration examples
- [ ] Add verbose mode support for MCP tool execution

## 7. Deployment and Packaging
- [ ] Ensure MCP dependencies are properly bundled
- [ ] Update Docker configuration for MCP server access
- [ ] Test MCP functionality in containerized environments
- [ ] Update build scripts to include MCP-related binaries if needed
